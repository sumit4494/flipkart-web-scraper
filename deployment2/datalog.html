      <td>This is a descent TV. The picture quality will be always better with TVs at this config (4K and QLED)  Upscaling is pretty good. The TV Series looks better of other contents like movie and PS4 (earlier version, not PS4 Pro) Do take a look at RTings review to make sure that you setup pictures correctly.I upgraded from 32 Sony TV to this (50 inch) with a viewing distance of 10 -11 feet.

      <td>The Frame- as the name suggests is more for as a decor than being a TV. You can get a better configuration TV at a cheaper price but this one has an edge due to its aesthetics.In standby mode the image gallery gives a look as if an art piece is hanging on a wall. The wallpaper can be put in a slideshow and it keeps on changing.One Connect is another feature which makes this TV almost wire free. Due to its zero space stand the Frame almost attaches to the wall without any gap.</td>

      <td>This is an excellent television in this price range. The sound output is great, however if you are going with the 50 inch version, it has only 20 watt output which is decent for a room, but might need a soundbar for a hall.The blacks are good but not as deep as an OLED. However, in the price range, you wouldn't get any better.Colour contrast is amazing with the QLED tech for the television. Being the Frame, with no gap wallmount and art mode, it's actually a cherry on the cake. I woul...</td>

Also viewing angles are not that good.The upscaling and video processing is not that good as well, specially for SD content. There is lot of judder if you turn on the high frame rate feature (Clear motion).Sound is ok. Anyways can't expect much from 40W speakers. The active voice amplifier feature seems gimmicky...</td>

      <td>Excellent buy, value for money. If you are looking for a tv in the 75-90k budget, then samsung frame is the best choice right now. The most value for money tv, no other brand comes close in this price sector. The frame concept is excellent but even without it, the TV stands high on its picture and performance. The Tizen os is a bit laggy but besides that this is the best tv to buy, the 55 inch version is most aggressively priced and should be the one to be bought. :)</td>
